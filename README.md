A list of AngularJS snippets I have written, to help me learn

* Alpha   - Simple angular code. We enter something, capture it & redisplay it.
* Bravo   - Custom directive, 2 sets data, collapsing bootstrap panels.
* Charlie - Like above plus capability to remove tasks using bootstrap glyphicon.
* Delta   - HTML5 Video - use spacebar to control.
* Echo    - Two-way binding examples, using textbox, radio, & dropdown HTML.
* Foxtrot - Higlighting AngularJS directive: ngClass
* Golf    - Setting up a basic the value service
* Hotel   -
* India   -
* Zulu    - the end

They all should run smoothly.
