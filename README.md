* Charlie - The above *plus* capability to remove tasks using bootstrap glyphicon.
* Delta   - HTML5 Video - use spacebar to control.
* Echo    - Two-way binding examples, using textbox, radio, & dropdown HTML.
* Foxtrot - Filters, regular ones and one custom one.
* Golf    - Setting up a basic the value service.
* Hotel   - Service - not working.
* India   - Input goodness.

* Mike    -
* November-

* Romeo   -
* Sierra  -

They all should run smoothly. Except if they don't.
