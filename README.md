A list of AngularJS snippets I have written, to help me learn

* Alpha   - Simple angular code. We enter something, capture it & redisplay it.
* Bravo   - Custom directive, 2 sets data, ng-repeat, collapsing bootstrap panels.
* Charlie - The above *plus* capability to remove tasks using bootstrap glyphicon.
* Delta   - HTML5 Video - use spacebar to control.
* Echo    - Two-way binding examples, using textbox, radio, & dropdown HTML.
* Foxtrot - Filters, regular ones and one custom one.
* Golf    - Setting up a basic the value service.
* Hotel   - Service - not working.
* India   - Input goodness.
* Juliett - Changing css class settings, using ngClass.
* Mike    - Using ng-include to include chunks of code.
* November- Animation
* Oscar   -
* Papa    -
* Quebec  -
* Romeo   -
* Sierra  - This will cover services.
* Tango   - Task Application
* Uniform -
* Victor  -
* Whiskey -
* Xray    -
* Yankee  -
* Zulu    - the end

They all should run smoothly. Except if they don't.
