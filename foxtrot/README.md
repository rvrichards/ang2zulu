This examines filters.

##index.html
This has two different filters, one is a "filter filter" and the other is an "orderBy filter". The app pulls the data from the controller.
* Filter filter - filters on a letter or group of letters that the user types in
* Filter orderBy - allows you to select a column in the table to **orderBy**: name, weight, or colour.
