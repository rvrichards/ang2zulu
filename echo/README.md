#ECHO Example

Showing Angulars two-way binding as well as Select Boxes

##index.html
Three different types of input. This example spells out the data hard coded in the HTML

-text
-radio
-drop down list (select-option)

##second.html
This example uses the ng-options. You can use ng-repeat, but I that does not handle objects like ng-options does. It also has the data stored in the controller as key-value pair.
