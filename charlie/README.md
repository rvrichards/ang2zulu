This displays 2 HTML panels, one open and one collapsed. Clicking on header will expand/collapse a panel. You are then able to delete a task by clicking on the "x". You'll be given a confirm/cancel choice.

* Two custom directives are used: **task-list** and **remove-task**.
* The controller has two functions: removeTask & collapsed.
* The removeTask module has three functions: startRemove, cancelRemove, and confirmRemove.
