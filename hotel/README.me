This will show different events.

##index.html
This shows ng-mousemove and ng-click. They are implemented in different ways, but could both be the same.

* ng-mousemove - this uses code within the element to count.
* ng-click - this counts using a function.
* ng-mousemove - this time passing an $event object to a function.
