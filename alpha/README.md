##index.html
Simple angular code. We enter something, capture it & redisplay it. Uses **ng-bind**. Using bootstrap.

We use **ng-model** directive, which binds an input, select, textarea (or custom form control) to a property on the scope.

Notice that we have not named the ng-app: **ng-app=""** We still need to have angular do its magic, so the angular code "{{ ... }}" still needs to be inside the div tag using ng-app.

##simple.html
Shows simple use of ng-app and ng-controller. The controller also has two variables that are used. It also uses inline scripts and not a script file.

##scope.html
Here I show rootScope and scope useage. You won't get much from the view but confirmation of what is described in the code.
